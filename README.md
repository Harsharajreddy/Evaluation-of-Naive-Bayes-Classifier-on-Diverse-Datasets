# Evaluation-of-Naive-Bayes-Classifier-on-Diverse-Datasets
This project implements the Naive Bayes classification algorithm and evaluates its performance on three distinct datasets: Hayes-Roth, Car, and Breast Cancer. It involves data preprocessing, handling missing values, and mapping categorical data to numerical values to ensure accurate classification.
